# Decision-making cortical circuit dynamics

This repository builds upon Wang 2002, _Probabilistic decision making by slow reverberation in cortical circuits_ and Ocker 2023, _Dynamics of Stochastic Integrate-and-Fire Networks_ to model the dynamics of cortical networks during decision making. This project also attempts to add interneuron classes into the stochastic LIF models and uncover their roles in decision-making computation. This is done under the mentorship of Dr. Gabriel Koch Ocker and Dr. Chandramouli Chandrasekaran
